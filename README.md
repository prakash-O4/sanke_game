## Introduction

Snake game is the simple flutter game which is mainly focused on the logic rather than the
User Interface. User Interface is very simple to use.

## Project Information

- Length of snake will grow after eating a food.
- food will appear in a random place in a green color
- When snake touches own body then the game will be over.
- Total Score will be calcualted by the length of snake.
